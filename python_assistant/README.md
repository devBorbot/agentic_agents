## Python Coding Assistant

This repository contains a Python-based coding assistant designed to enhance coding workflows. It leverages AI-powered tools for code suggestions, debugging, documentation generation, and formatting. The assistant can be used interactively via Jupyter notebooks or a Streamlit web interface.

---

### **Features**

- **Code Suggestions**: Provides improvements based on user-defined problems.
- **Debugging Assistance**: Analyzes error messages and suggests fixes.
- **Docstring Generation**: Creates Google-style docstrings for Python functions and classes.
- **Code Formatting**: Formats code using the Black formatter for consistent style.
- **Interactive Usage**:
    - Custom Jupyter magic commands for seamless integration.
    - Web interface powered by Streamlit for user-friendly interaction.

### **Files Overview**

#### **1. `coding_agent.py`**

- Initializes the AI model (`HfApiModel`) from Hugging Face.
- Sets up the `CodeAgent` with tools for code suggestions, debugging, docstring generation, and formatting.
- Tools:
    - `code_suggester`: Suggests improvements to provided code.
    - `code_debugger`: Debugs code snippets based on error messages.
    - `docstring_generator`: Generates docstrings for Python functions/classes.
    - `code_formatter`: Formats Python code using Black.


#### **2. `coding_tools.py`**

Contains tool definitions used by the `CodeAgent`:

- **`code_suggester()`**: Provides real-time code improvement suggestions.
- **`code_debugger()`**: Debugs Python code using Pylint analysis.
- **`docstring_generator()`**: Generates Google-style docstrings.
- **`code_formatter()`**: Formats code using the Black library.


#### **3. `jupyter_integration.py`**

Integrates the assistant into Jupyter notebooks via custom magic commands:

- **`init_jupyter()`**: Registers a `%agent` magic command for interacting with the assistant directly in notebooks.
    - *Line Magic*: `%agent &lt;input&gt;` executes tasks based on the input line.
    - *Cell Magic*: `%%agent &lt;input&gt;` processes both line and cell content.


#### **4. `app.py`**

Provides a web-based interface using Streamlit:

- Allows users to input Python code and select tasks (e.g., suggestions, debugging, docstring generation, formatting).
- Displays results interactively with error handling and troubleshooting tips.

### **Setup Instructions**

#### **1. Install Dependencies**

Run the following command to install required libraries:

```bash
pip install streamlit torch transformers smolagents black pylint
```


#### **2. Run the Streamlit App**

Start the web interface by running:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```


#### **3. Use in Jupyter Notebooks**

To enable Jupyter integration:

1. Import and call `init_jupyter()` in your notebook:

```python
from jupyter_integration import init_jupyter
init_jupyter()
```

2. Use `%agent` or `%%agent` magic commands to interact with the assistant.

### **Troubleshooting**

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed (`torch`, `transformers`, etc.).
2. Verify the Hugging Face authentication token is valid in `coding_agent.py`.
3. Restart the application or notebook after resolving errors.
